# Ruby on Rails Project

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed:
- Ruby
- Bundler
- Redis (for Sidekiq)
- PostgreSQL (or the database you are using)

## Installation

1. Install project dependencies:
   ```sh
   bundle install
   ```

2. Copy environment variables:
   ```sh
   cat .env.sample >> .env
   ```

3. Set up the database:
   ```sh
   rails db:create
   rails db:migrate
   ```

4. Optionally, load initial data:
   ```sh
   rails db:seed
   rails runner db/seeds/users.rb
   ```

## Running the Application

1. Start Sidekiq for background processing:
   ```sh
   bundle exec sidekiq
   ```

2. Build TailwindCSS styles:
   ```sh
   rails tailwindcss:build
   ```

3. Start the Rails server:
   ```sh
   rails server
   ```

## Additional Notes

- Ensure Redis is running before starting Sidekiq.
- You can modify the seed data in `db/seeds/` as needed.
- For more details about the application, check the internal documentation or source code.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
